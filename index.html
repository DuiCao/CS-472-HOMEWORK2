            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Dui Cao.

                I am a senior international student currently attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I majored in information science, and I learned coding languages including Java and HTML.
                
                I personally really enjoy playing basketball or going to video games because I donâ€™t have too many friends in Madison, so I often do those things by myself.
                
                My Yorksia dog, who is small, is a constant source of happiness and company.</p>
